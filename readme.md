# :bird: Bird Tech

Hi! I'm just uploading a small number of scripts related to my project [Bird by Example](https://noahburkholder.itch.io/bird-by-example). The project is on a private repository, but I've exposed some C# scripts that employers and other developers may be curious about.

Specifically:
1. ([NeuralNet.cs](Scripts/NeuralNet.cs)) The Recurrent Neural Network system I'm using. It's very customized to the weirdness of Bird by Example, but I've commented it extensively to help it make sense.
2. ([BirdIdentity.cs](Scripts/BirdIdentity.cs)) A script used for introducing fluctuations in contextual perception. In other words: If all birds were to share the same neurology, this script makes bird perceptrons interpret the environment differently. This system will be toggleable in the end product, so that experimentation with social cohesion behaviour is afforded to curious players.

I'll update this repo from time to time if there's a script which people are asking about. I talk a fair bit about the systems on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/UWeXjUf) so sometimes it makes sense to link to a public codebase.

Cheers,

Noah
