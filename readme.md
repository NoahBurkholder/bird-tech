# :bird: Bird Tech

Hi! I'm just uploading a small number of scripts related to my project [Bird by Example](https://noahburkholder.itch.io/bird-by-example). The project is on a private repository, but I've exposed some C# scripts that employers and other developers may be curious about.

Specifically:
(NeuralNet.cs) The Recurrent Neural Network system I'm using. It's very customized to the weirdness of Bird by Example, but I've commented it extensively to help it make sense.

I'll update this repo from time to time if there's a script which people are asking about. I talk a fair bit about the systems on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/UWeXjUf) so sometimes it makes sense to link to a public codebase.

Cheers,

Noah
